# Space Invaders Game
## Description

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where you control a spaceship to defend Earth from invading aliens. This project is a Python implementation of the game using the Pygame library.

## Features

- Classic arcade gameplay with a modern twist.
- Player-controlled spaceship with the ability to shoot lasers.
- Increasing difficulty as you progress through levels.
- High-score tracking to compete with friends.

## How to Play

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

    ```bash
   pip install pygame --user 
    ```

3. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deelipsingh77/Space-Invaders.git
    cd Space-Invaders
    ```

4. **Run the Game:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. **Controls:**
    - Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship left and right.
    - Press the spacebar to shoot lasers at the invaders.
    - Esc to Pause and Unpause

6. **Objective:** Your goal is to destroy all the invading aliens before they reach Earth. If any alien reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose!

7. **Scoring:** You earn points for each alien you destroy. Try to achieve the highest score possible.

8. **Leveling Up:** The game gets progressively harder as you advance through levels. The aliens will move faster and be more challenging to defeat.
